# HandwritingToLatex
This repo contains machine learning algorithms used to convert handwritten math expressions to LaTeX format. OpenCV was used to segment and obtain bounding boxes around characters in equations. Transfer learning and Resnet architecture was used to train model and achieve a validation accuracy of 96%.

**Machine Learning Project (1).mp4**- This video summarizes the project and provides a demo of our algorithm.

**APS360_Project (1).ipynb**- This file contains the loading, cleaning of data and building of the models. It also contains visualization of the data sources for training and some demo examples.
